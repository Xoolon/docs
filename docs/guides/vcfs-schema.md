# VCFS Schema

The **Valcr Commerce Financial Schema (VCFS)** is the structured data model that underpins all Valcr benchmark comparisons, scores, and insights. Understanding it is essential for submitting accurate merchant data and interpreting API responses.

---

## What is VCFS?

VCFS is a canonical financial schema designed specifically for commerce operators. It normalizes the diverse financial data structures that exist across different platforms (Shopify, Amazon, WooCommerce, QuickBooks, etc.) into a single, consistent model that enables apples-to-apples comparison.

Every field maps to a standard XBRL taxonomy element, enabling structured regulatory export.

| 1.00 | Full score confidence + all export formats |

The `completeness_score` and `missing_fields` array are returned in every `POST /merchant/vcfs` response.

## Minimum viable submission

The minimum fields required for any benchmark comparison:

```json
